#### ✍🏻 Comments
Hello, I am [@myeong-han](https://github.com/myeong-han/), a **generalist-oriented** developer.

I plan to develop useful services or make fun attempts by utilizing various languages, frameworks, open sources, and infrastructures.   
~TMI: I am also interested in photography, video production, and Blender and game engines.~

I sincerely respect all the teachers who teach their students with great enthusiasm at home or abroad, as well as the instructors who create good lectures online.

Thank you for visiting, I hope you have a nice day.
